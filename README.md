Repo for the April 2025 Harvard EasyA Hackathon
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

[Polkadot Discord](https://polkadot-discord.w3f.tools/) (make sure you select the builder role to get access to the right channels) | **You must attend** all the in-person workshops in the schedule to be eligible to enter this track. |

> **Judging** (donâ€™t worry - itâ€™s not scary at all! ðŸ˜„)
> 
- **WHEN** | Demo day will be on Sunday (see schedule for precise timings).
- **HOW** | Judging will be done in person on Sunday. If you entered the coding track, there are 2 phases of judging. First, youâ€™ll show your project to the judges at their judging table (this is an informal opportunity for you to show your code to them). Second, **top projects will then be selected to present formally to everyone on stage!**

- **PRESENTING (TECHNICAL TRACK)** | If youâ€™re selected to present for the technical tracks, hereâ€™s how it will go:
    - 20 seconds to connect your computer to the projector.
    - 3 mins to present.
    - 1 min for Q&A.

If you go over time, points will be deducted from your team. Your time will start as soon as the last team has stopped presenting and has left the stage.

Simply complete this submission form: https://forms.gle/jyinTU8TPmGZdY137 

> **Submission requirements âœ…**
> 

**Projects must:**

1. Be built with smart contracts on Polkadot Asset Hub

Deployed: <INSERT SMART CONTRACT ADDRESS (Ideally with blockexplorer link.)

2. Be open source (and remain available as open source)

<Link to License.txt>

3. Include a short summary (<150 chars)

BLURB

4. Include a full description (the problems it solves, how Polkadot was used to achieve it)

Bluesky Use Case

Tipping on Frequency? (future?)

5. Include a technical description (what SDKs were used, and what features of Polkadot made this uniquely possible)

<INSERT STACK DESCRIPTION>

6. Include a link to the Canva slides used in the presentation (including a slide on your team, problem, solution etc). You must use Canva for your presentation (yes, this is a requirement).

<INSERT LINK>

- **PRESENTING STRUCTURE** | Follow this structure when presenting:
    1. First 30 seconds for each team member to introduce yourselves (which employer/university youâ€™re from, which year, what youâ€™re majoring in etc). **Make sure you have a team slide!**
    
    2. Next 30 seconds to explain the problem youâ€™re solving
    
    3. Next 30 seconds to explain your solution and grand vision - show off how big this can get
  - Innovation and Originality: The novelty of the solution and its potential to disrupt or significantly improve upon existing services.
  - Impact Potential: The applicability and scalability of the solution in real-world scenarios, including its potential for adoption and the breadth of its impact on the target market or sector.

    5. Next 30 seconds showing off your demo - show off how much you achieved!
  - Usability and Design: The application's user experience and interface design, ensuring accessibility and ease of use for its intended audience.

    6. Next 30 seconds explaining how you used Polkadot in your project (For coding submissions) Technical Implementation: The robustness, security, and efficiency of the applicationâ€™s codebase. Proper use of smart contracts and adherence to best practices in dApp development will be crucial.
    - Use of the Blockchain: Effective use of smart contracts on Polkadot Asset Hub in the solution, demonstrating an understanding of their benefits and limitations.
    
    7. Final 30 seconds on future roadmap and what youâ€™ll do next
    - Feasibility: The practicality of implementing the solution and the clarity of the implementation plan.

Technical:

7. (For coding submissions) Have a custom (not boilerplate) smart contract on Polkadot Asset Hub (and committed to your GitHub repo). All of this must be fully-functioning, as evidenced in a demo video on your README (see point 8 below).

8. (For coding submissions) Include a clear README on your GitHub repo explaining how your project works. This README must include:

    1. A demo video

    2. Screenshots of your UI

    3. Description of how your smart contract works

    4. A video with audio (e.g. a Loom video [like this](https://youtu.be/ZLKR4zE1o6U?si=6na7139wlVNkmJRa)) explaining how your project works, how the GitHub repo is structured, a demo of everything working etc. This is vital, so that the judges can review your project properly. Make sure you explain clearly how you satisfied point 7 above. This is a great example of a winning Polkadot projectâ€™s README: https://github.com/jjjutla/melodot. Bonus points for if your video is well-edited!

    5. Block explorer link for deployed smart contract on Asset Hub

Please make sure you follow the above requirements very carefully. If you do not satisfy them, you will not be eligible for a guaranteed prize.
