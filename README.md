# supertip

This is the source repository for the April 2025 Harvard EasyA Hackathon submission of the Supertip project by the Bigtippers.

Supertip brings the proposed [open tipping tokens protocol](https://github.com/degen-token/DIPs/blob/main/dip-0002.md) to **<u>any social media supporting decentralized identities</u>**. 

Bluesky Use Case

Tipping on Frequency? (future?)

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


# Submission requirements ✅-List

1. [X] Be built with smart contracts on Polkadot Asset Hub

Contract Address: 0x888175972F6570894e7CA8F1cAe817047c9Ba835

Code: [Tip.sol](https://github.com/bigtippers/supertip/blob/main/solidity/contracts/Tip.sol)

Deployed (via REMIX): [https://blockscout-asset-hub.parity-chains-scw.parity.io/address/0x888175972F6570894e7CA8F1cAe817047c9Ba835](https://blockscout-asset-hub.parity-chains-scw.parity.io/address/0x888175972F6570894e7CA8F1cAe817047c9Ba835)

2. [X] Be open source (and remain available as open source)

Released under [AGPLv3.0 or later](https://github.com/bigtippers/supertip/blob/main/COPYING). 

3. [X] Include a short summary (<150 chars)

Supertip brings token tipping to **<u>any social media supporting decentralized identities</u>**. 

See [Intro](#supertip) for more.

4. [ ] Include a full description (the problems it solves, how Polkadot was used to achieve it)

See [Intro](#supertip).

5. [ ] Include a technical description (what SDKs were used, and what features of Polkadot made this uniquely possible)

See [Technical Details](#technical-details).

6. [ ] Include a link to the Canva slides used in the presentation (including a slide on your team, problem, solution etc). You must use Canva for your presentation (yes, this is a requirement).

See [Presentation](#presentation)

7. [X] (For coding submissions) Have a custom (not boilerplate) smart contract on Polkadot Asset Hub (and committed to your GitHub repo). All of this must be fully-functioning, as evidenced in a demo video on your README (see point 8 below).


8. [ ] (For coding submissions) Include a clear README on your GitHub repo explaining how your project works. This README must include:

    1. [ ] A demo video - See [Demo Video](#demo-video)

    2. [ ] Screenshots of your UI - See [Screenshots](#screenshots)

    3. [ ] Description of how your smart contract works - See [Smart Contract Details](#smart-contract-details)

    4. [ ] A video with audio (e.g. a Loom video [like this](https://youtu.be/ZLKR4zE1o6U?si=6na7139wlVNkmJRa)) explaining how your project works, how the GitHub repo is structured, a demo of everything working etc. This is vital, so that the judges can review your project properly. Make sure you explain clearly how you satisfied point 7 above. This is a great example of a winning Polkadot project’s README: https://github.com/jjjutla/melodot. Bonus points for if your video is well-edited! - See [Presentation](#presentation)

    5. [X] Block explorer link for deployed smart contract on Asset Hub - Deployed (via REMIX): [https://blockscout-asset-hub.parity-chains-scw.parity.io/address/0x888175972F6570894e7CA8F1cAe817047c9Ba835](https://blockscout-asset-hub.parity-chains-scw.parity.io/address/0x888175972F6570894e7CA8F1cAe817047c9Ba835)


- **PRESENTING STRUCTURE** | Follow this structure when presenting:
    1. First 30 seconds for each team member to introduce yourselves (which employer/university you’re from, which year, what you’re majoring in etc). **Make sure you have a team slide!**
    
    2. Next 30 seconds to explain the problem you’re solving
    
    3. Next 30 seconds to explain your solution and grand vision - show off how big this can get
  - Innovation and Originality: The novelty of the solution and its potential to disrupt or significantly improve upon existing services.
  - Impact Potential: The applicability and scalability of the solution in real-world scenarios, including its potential for adoption and the breadth of its impact on the target market or sector.

    5. Next 30 seconds showing off your demo - show off how much you achieved!
  - Usability and Design: The application's user experience and interface design, ensuring accessibility and ease of use for its intended audience.

    6. Next 30 seconds explaining how you used Polkadot in your project (For coding submissions) Technical Implementation: The robustness, security, and efficiency of the application’s codebase. Proper use of smart contracts and adherence to best practices in dApp development will be crucial.
